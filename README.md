**Python Scripts to run through PyBank and PyPoll**

1) PyBank analyzes the financial records of a company. We find:

    A) The total number of months included in the dataset

    B) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    C) The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    D) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
    E) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

2) PyPoll
    
    A) The total number of votes cast
    
    B) A complete list of candidates who received votes
    
    C) The percentage of votes each candidate won
    
    D) The total number of votes each candidate won
    
    E) The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Time it takes to run the script is ~5 seconds.


*Note** My Python Scripts are in [Instructions](https://github.com/slobanwala1/python-challenge/tree/main/Instructions) as well as in [my_submission](https://github.com/slobanwala1/VBA-challenge/tree/main/my_submission) folder are the snapshots for how it would look when the script is ran. Also the script is there and in [Resources](https://github.com/slobanwala1/VBA-challenge/tree/master/Instructions/Resources).
