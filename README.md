    B) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    C) The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    D) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
    E) The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

2) PyPoll
    
    A) The total number of votes cast
    
    B) A complete list of candidates who received votes
    
    C) The percentage of votes each candidate won
    
    D) The total number of votes each candidate won
    
    E) The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Time it takes to run the script is ~5 seconds.
